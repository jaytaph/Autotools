Even though the --enable-world from our last example works, the compilation is still not what we want. Our program still consists of two differnt objects: hello.o and world.o. It would be nice if we can actually remove the whole world.o object when we don't want our "world" message to be displayed.

For this to work, we need to change the Makefile.am a bit. We conditionally add the world.c to the hello sources, depending on the variable COMPILE_WITH_WORLD, which is set in the configure.ac file.
