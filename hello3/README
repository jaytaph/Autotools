This is the first "autotooled" source for our helloworld application.

There are a few mandatory files that needs to be present: AUTHORS, README, COPYING, ChangeLog. This is because GNU says so. You CAN leave them blank though, as I did for most files.

Notice that there are only 2 "configuration" files: Makefile.am and configure.ac.

The Makefile.am is handcrafted and consists of not much more than defining where our software should be installed and what it is made out of. 

The configure.ac file is generated by the system, and modified by us. The generating can be done by running "autoscan".

To actually create the software, take a look at the "compile.sh" script.
